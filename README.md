# Sample code for Common Crawl WARC files + Hadoop/Spark

I pulled out some code from a Common Crawl project to answer an old Stack Overflow question.

The interesting file is src/main/scala/com/banshee/ccspark/RawWarc.scala.  It contains code to let you open WARC files in Hadoop/Spark.

# TODO

Release this as an actual library.
